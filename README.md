### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential sound latency issues

> If you‚Äôre running this game on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), you may experience some latency issues with the sounds.
This is due to the fact that WSL is an emulation layer for running Linux applications on Windows, and as such, it may not provide the same level of performance as running natively on Linux or Windows.
If you‚Äôre experiencing latency issues, you might want to restart the game one few more times, or try running the game natively on Linux or Windows to see if that improves the latency.
